Write a Cake class that has the following instance variables:

-  numberOfCandles
-  icingFlavour
-  message

A method called describeCake that returns a String containing a description of the Cake

Now, write a Start class with a main method and start instantiating
Cake objects!

Instantiate a Cake object with 5 candles, chocolate icing, and a message that says:  Happy Birthday.

Instantiate a second Cake object that has 50 candles, vanilla icing and a message that says:  Congratulations!

Use the describeCake method to print out a description of each Cake object

Next, describe every variable in your program as to:
•	primitive vs reference
•	instance vs local
•	what is stored inside of the variable?
•	Where is the variable stored/

Finally, draw a memory diagram (Stack, Heap, Method areas) of the program just before the JVM returns from the describeCake method.
