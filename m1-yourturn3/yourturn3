Write a Car class that has instance variables to track:

    - the licensePlateNumber
    - the model
    - the colour
    - the year the car was manufactured...

Make sure that your instance variables are protected from tampering (make them private)

Provide a full constructor and an empty constructor and getters/setters for all of them.

If a calling class tries to set the year instance variable to any date before 2000 or after 2015, 
throw an exception

Next, write a class called Start that has a main method.  Now, instantiate two Car objects, one using the full constructor
and one using the empty constructor and the setters to populate the instance variables.
