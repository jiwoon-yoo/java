Write a Heart class that contains an instance variable called
BPM  (beatsPerMinute) that tracks how many beats per minute
the heart is beating

add a constructor and getter and setter as needed
Be sure that BPM can't be set to anything less than 50 beats
per minute.  throw an exception if needed.

add a method called oneMinute that will print out
"Thumpity" for every heart beat in a minute.
So, if BPM was set to 67, then Thumpity will print out 67 times
